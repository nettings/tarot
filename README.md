# tarot
A block device duplicator with web frontend, to help you create multiple clones of SD cards and other media in parallel.

# Status
*tarot* is currently in its early development stages and not ready for use
just yet.

# Software requirements
*tarot* requires dcfldd and a web server environment with PHP.

# Hardware requirements
*tarot* is being tested and developed on a Raspberry Pi 4B and a 13-way IcyBox
USB3 hub containing 13 Transcend SD and ÂµSD card reader/writers.

It is quite Linux-specific, but should should run on any distribution on any
platform.

# Kudos

tarot has been inspired by [Aaron Nguyen's
osid-python3](https://github.com/aaronnguyen/osid-python3), which in turn
draws on earlier work by [Rock &
Scissor](https://github.com/rockandscissor/osid).
